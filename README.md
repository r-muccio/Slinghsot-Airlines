<h1>Slingshot Airlines!</h1>

This full web stack application is built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

As part of this project for Concordia Univerity, I was given some broken code and was asked to fix it. The scenario was that the previous developer had abruptly quit his job, so I was hired to make his broken code function. Some basic server scaffolding was provided, and some broken front end code was also provided. No database had been set up.
